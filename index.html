    <h1>My Personal Profile</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hello there!</p>
    <p>My name is Jesse James Kang'ethe Macibi. I am a citizen of Kenya by birth and I reside in Ruiru, Kiambu. I am currently 18 years of age now, born in the month infamous for very cold weather here in Kenya, July, on the 29th. I am the first born in a family of three children.</p>
    <p>Before going any further I would like to thank you for taking your time to read this Personal Profile Website. This just but a short intro about me, my past,present, hopes for the future,bits of my philosophies,likes and dislikes and other things that will showcase my personality.</p>
    <h2>My Past</h2>
    <p>Everyone's past is quite A LOOOOTTTT to cover even with in a website.I mean if I could tell you all about my past I would write a book and even if I sat for years writing it, I couldn't exahust everything I have experienced in my life. It's just too many stories combined..... So for now allow me to give a short summary entailing what that I feel were very important events in my past. </p>
    <p> The biggest part of my background as an eighteen year old boy is mostly my educational life.My primary and high school experiences take the biggest percentage of my past.</p>
    <p>To this day, I have been in conflict to whether educational smarts is what has been for me. Because in both of the biggest exams that I took I was quite far from reaching my set goal. Not only that but also failing to reach my set minimum by one point/grade. I was always in question of my intelligence because I showed many inconsistencies. At one time I said or did something brilliant and others... Let's just say they were moments to reflect upon .</p>
    <p>While in school I did other things such as sing in the choir or dance infront of people. Just engaging in thing that would break the monotony of a boring school life and also to relieve the pressure laid by academics.</p>
    <h2>Likes and Dislikes</h2>
    <P>Since I  was young I have had a passion for games, computers,dancing and music. As I grew up I grew a passion for basketball as a sport. I do my best to grow my skills in these likes of mine. I have a great amount of love for delicious food as you can see from the background image for this section of the Profile.I also like keeping up with a good series or movie.</P>
    <p>However, I have a dislike for many things. Right from lack of sleep to a code not being able to run because of a colon. Dislikes for me is another broad topic of discussion.Covering it at the moment will take sometime. So to digress to something that can be better explained.
    <h2>My Current Affairs</h2>
    <p>So like my past, at the moment the biggest thing going on is school here in Moringa School, which is a school offering bootcamp courses for Tech such as the one I am currently doing(Software Engineering). Infact, this website is my first project in the school.Hopefully I do well in it. So yeah not really much. No partying, no special someone, just a guy wanting to change his life for the better. </p>
    <p>The only other thing I could be up to is having a full time job as an older brother to my lovely sisters. Otherwise I am just building skills and trying to grow as a person.</p>
    <h3>My Hope and Dreams</h3>
    <p>So as you have read there really is not much with my life. I am genuinely just a chill guy. I aspire to be a highly skilled Game Developer and Software Engineer. I also would like to have a family of my own and many other things I dream to have and be</p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>So..... YEAHHH. That's a brief summary of my life. Hopefully things in the future will get more interesting for those dozing off while reading my profile. Once again I appreciate you for taking your time to read this profile of mine despite it not being the best I will make another one which will be much better and even more detailed. </p>
    <p>For now it's goodbye. Follow my page if you would like to get updates on new things coming soon.</p>
